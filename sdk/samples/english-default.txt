Russia launched large-scale drone and missile strikes on Ukraine's capital and other parts of the country early on Friday, officials said.

At least three people were killed and 49 injured in the strikes, according to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The aerial raids targeted Kyiv, as well as the city of Lutsk and the Ternopil region in the north-west of the country.

Russia's defence ministry said the strikes were in response to "terrorist acts by the Kyiv regime", adding that it had targeted military sites.

The ministry said its armed forces "overnight launched a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, sea and ground-based weapons, as well as attack drones".

The attack came after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned US President Donald Trump he would respond to Ukraine's recent strikes on Russian airbases.
